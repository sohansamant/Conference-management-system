# Conference-management-system

A flexible enough to be easily adaptable for most conference needs. The aspects that Comas directly handles are:
* Receiving, voting, approving papers
* Creating proceedings
* Scheduling talks
* Managing attendance (pre-registration, nametag printing, charging for participation depending on what talks they are interested in, managing day-to-day attendance, preparing diplomas...)
* Various administrative tasks

It is best suited for academic conferences (i.e., conferences where the main intrerest are the presentations, not commercial meetings,
which are also called conferences in some countries).
